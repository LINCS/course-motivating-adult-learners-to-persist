        <title>1. Setting appropriate goals</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Goals are extremely important in motivating and directing behavior. Adults often have very
general ideas about why they need or want to learn to read and write. To motivate persistence
and success, instructors need to help learners break down their learning goals into short-term and
long-term literacy goals. If learners set near-term goals, not just distant ones, they are much more
likely to experience success, which enhances self-efficacy. Supporting learners’ awareness of
progress week-by-week can motivate persistence as learners reach their near-term goals and
recognize that these are the path to reaching long-term goals.
There are also different types of goals, the choice of which can influence learning outcomes:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a learner holds a mastery goal, he or she engages with a task in order to improve
ability; the goal is to truly master the task. When students hold this type of goal, the point
of comparison is the student him- or herself. That is, the student compares his or her
present performance to past performance to gauge improvement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a learner holds a performance-approach goal, the goal is to demonstrate his or
her ability relative to others; the students compare their performance to that of other
students, with the goal of demonstrating greater competence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When a learner holds a performance-avoidance goal, the student’s goal is to avoid
appearing incompetent or “dumb.” Such students would want to avoid appearing to
others that they have poor literacy skills.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.7rem;"&gt;Learning environments can be structured in ways that encourage learners to set different types of
goals. If a teacher emphasizes the importance of mastering literacy skills, learners are likely to
adopt mastery goals; if a teacher emphasizes relative ability (i.e., the teacher inadvertently makes
comments that position adult learners as “good” or “bad” readers), learners are likely to adopt
performance goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.7rem;"&gt;Adopting mastery goals predicts positive outcomes that include persisting at tasks, choosing to
engage in similar activities in the future, and using effective cognitive and self-regulatory
strategies. Performance-avoidance goals consistently predict negative outcomes, including&amp;nbsp;increased use of self-handicapping strategies and poor achievement. Results for performanceapproach goals are mixed, with some studies finding that they are related to positive outcomes
and others finding the opposite. (p. 13-14)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>3. Assisting learners in managing errors</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Students of all ages can find errors demotivating. Research suggests the benefits of error
management—that is, leading adults to expect errors as a part of the learning process and then
providing strategies for coping with errors and learning from them. Instructors need to know how
to recognize and correct ingrained negative attributions by providing feedback that stresses the
processes of learning, such as the importance of using strategies, monitoring one’s own
understanding, and engaging in sustained effort even in the face of challenges. (p.15)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>4. Reframing explanations in ways that motivate persistence</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Experiences with learning can trigger questions such as: Why did I do badly? (after receiving a
low score on an evaluation). Why can’t I understand this? (after failing to comprehend a
paragraph). Why can’t I write sentences that make sense? (after being unable to write a coherent
short story). The “attributions” students form in response to such questions—in other words, how
they explain the reasons for their successes and failures to themselves—will either motivate them
to persist or discourage them from doing so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;A learner who is experiencing difficulty comprehending a text, for example, will be more likely
to persist if he or she attributes the difficulty to something external (for example, a boring text),
something uncontrollable (being ill), or something unstable (feeling depressed that day). A&amp;nbsp;learner who experiences success at a task will be more likely to persist if progress is attributed to
something internal (for example, personal enjoyment of reading), controllable (practice,
spending a lot of time working on the text), and stable (a belief in one’s ability as a reader).&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;When a student does not experience success—for example, if he or she is unable to make sense
of the overarching point of a short story—instructors can help the learner employ reading
strategies that can elucidate the story’s meaning and also provide a different frame for thinking
about the reasons for the learner’s difficulties and errors. With repeated reframing, instructors
can help learners develop attributional styles that allow learners to employ strategies and skills
that are more likely to lead them to persist. (p.15)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>6. Using assessments appropriately</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;While assessments are important, the ways in which they are administered and the feedback
presented can affect learners’ motivation in either positive or negative ways. Stressing the
importance of assessments and tests can lead students to adopt performance goals—goals in
which a student compares his or her progress to that of others. These goals are related to some
problematic academic outcomes, particularly when students are preoccupied with the goal of
avoiding appearing incompetent. When students are focused on how they compare to others
academically, they may use less-efficient cognitive strategies and engage in various self-handicapping behaviors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;To avoid demotivating students, instructors should:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Present the results of assessments privately. Presenting assessment results in a public
manner is conducive to students adopting performance rather than mastery goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Encourage students to focus on effort and improvement whenever possible. Motivation is
strengthened if students feel they can improve if they work hard at a task. Intrinsic
motivation is enhanced when students are rewarded on the basis of their improvement
rather than on absolute scores.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Allow the student to take an assessment again if he or she does not receive an acceptable
score. (p. 16)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>7. Finding value</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;A person may persist with a task that is not initially intrinsically interesting if it is valued. Value
refers to learners’ beliefs about whether a domain or task is enjoyable (intrinsically interesting),
useful, important to identity or sense of self, and worth investing time in.
These dimensions work together; a less-than-skilled reader may nevertheless approach a difficult
reading task with strong motivation to persist if the task is interesting, useful, or important to his
or her identity. One study, for example, illustrated the value that adolescent readers attached to
various texts because those texts taught them important life lessons or provided information
necessary for fitting in with a group or social network.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Although valuing an activity is important for learning in the context of compulsory education, it
is vital for persistence in adult literacy education. If adult learners develop and maintain positive
values about the literacy activities they engage in—if they believe that the courses are useful,
important, interesting, and worth their time—they will be more likely to persist with learning.
More research is needed, however, on the approaches instructors can use to help adult and
adolescent learners develop these values over time in relation to language and literacy activities
they may not already value. (19-2)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>2. Offering feedback to build a growth mindset</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Self-efficacy requires having fairly accurate perceptions of one’s current competencies.
Overestimating one’s ability to read and understand a text, for instance, will not lead to engaging
in the behaviors needed to develop new skills. Underestimating one’s abilities may lead to
coping or hiding behaviors that prevent the learner from making use of his or her existing skills.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;In addition, learners can have certain beliefs about intelligence that can affect their self-efficacy
and as a result their personal goals for learning. Students who hold an incremental view of
intelligence believe that intelligence is malleable and that it is possible to learn just about
anything. These students are likely to adopt mastery goals. In contrast, students who believe that
intelligence is fixed so that a person cannot effectively learn more than they are naturally capable
of learning are likely to adopt performance goals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;It appears possible, however, to alter beliefs about intelligence. For instance, feedback that
focuses a learner’s attention on how learning happens—for example, on the use of strategies,
effort, practice, and the general changeable and controllable nature of learning— can foster more
incremental views of ability with positive outcomes. (p.14)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>9. Encouraging collaboration and cooperation</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Cooperation or collaboration in the classroom can motivate learners to persist and attain their
goals. Learning environments and experiences that help establish positive relations with others
while developing competence in particular skills also shape engagement, motivation, and
persistence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Collaborative arrangements in which students work together to plan, draft, revise, or edit their
texts can have a positive impact on the quality of their writing, but students need clear direction
about what they are expected to do as they work with others. Opportunities to collaborate during
reading and writing also can increase motivation, although more needs to be known about how to
structure collaborations effectively.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Adults may also become more engaged if reading and writing activities provide opportunities to
work with other adults to solve real-world problems. In addition to increasing the usefulness of
literacy-based tasks and the sense of autonomy and control people have over their lives, these
collective literacy activities may provide them with the community support needed to persist in
developing their literacy even in the face of challenges. (p. 21-22)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>8. Providing choice and autonomy</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;When learners believe that they have some control over their own learning, they are more likely
to take on challenges and to persist with difficult tasks, compared with students who perceive
that they have little control over their learning outcomes. A controlling or pressured climate in a
classroom, home, or work group is known to decrease motivation to perform a variety of
behaviors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Providing people with choice about what activities to do and how to do them can increase
intrinsic motivation, provided that the number of options offered is not overwhelming.
Experiencing higher levels of perceived self-control predicts numerous positive outcomes,
among them engagement in school and academic achievement. The amount of autonomy a
learner desires, however, appears to depend on how competent and self-efficacious he or she
feels. If the task is new or especially challenging, an individual may appreciate having little
autonomy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Building a sense of learner autonomy and control does not mean abandoning adults to learn on
their own; there are a number of ways that instructors can give their students autonomy without
sacrificing best practices such as providing specific feedback, offering explicit and clear
modeling of strategies, and monitoring progress, all of which develop proficiencies and so
support greater autonomy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Providing a rationale for a task or behavior also can support perceived autonomy. For instance,
one study found that providing a meaningful rationale for doing an uninteresting activity,
acknowledging that participants might not want to do the activity, and minimizing the use of
controlling language led to increased reports of autonomy. (p. 18- 19)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>

        <title>10. Overcoming systemic barriers to persistence</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;When designing adult literacy instruction, it is important to consider the contexts of adults’ lives
and how to remove demotivating barriers to access and practice. For adults to enroll and continue
participating in adult literacy courses, they must perceive the courses as being important, useful,
interesting, and worth the investment of time. They must also believe they can handle the short-term consequences of spending time improving their literacy, which may include temporarily
having less time available for work and family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Effective functioning in adulthood requires selectively allocating effort toward the most
important and pressing goals in accord with the opportunities available. People allocate their
cognitive, emotional, and physical resources to prioritize important goals, balancing
responsibilities across work, family, community, and so on. In this light, lack of persistence in
adult literacy instruction, while appearing to be a poor choice, actually may be a self-regulated,
adaptive response to the constraints of competing demands and the need for trade-offs in life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;It should not be surprising, then, that the need for child care is a serious practical issue that
affects participation and persistence. It is likely that programs to increase the availability of child&amp;nbsp;care, particularly at no cost or at reduced rates, would facilitate the participation of many adults.

        <title>11. Addressing negative effects of stereotypes</title>
        <contents>&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Stereotype threat is an individual’s concern that others in a group will judge her or him by a
dominant stereotype. Stereotype threat is strong enough to disrupt performance and is typically
heightened in situations in which individuals who might be connected with such a stereotype
(e.g., “women are not good at mathematics”) represent only a small number in the overall group.
In one study, for example, black college students who had demonstrated high capability in other
testing situations performed poorly when told that their intelligence was being measured.
Stereotype threats have also been documented among members of other racial and ethnic groups,
as well as with respect to gender and cultural differences.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;These findings have important implications for any adult literacy program or course in which
groups come together from a variety of racial, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds, as well as for
mixed-gender groups. Indeed, stereotype threat can compromise learning in adult populations
because it can be triggered by age. In Western culture, education is most strongly associated with
childhood and early adulthood, and adult participation in formal instruction may be perceived as
not happening at the “appropriate” time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Awareness of stereotypes may divert attention that is needed to perform well on a task.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;When stereotypes are activated—in other words, when the learner is made aware of features of
the stereotype that are relevant to him or her—working memory resources needed for effective
performance may be diminished by distracting thoughts. Stereotype threat can be activated by
seemingly innocuous features of the learning situation, like reporting one’s gender on a
mathematics test.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"&gt;Because worries about whether one will confirm a stereotype to some extent involve inner
speech, interventions that steer learners toward verbalizations that help them to focus on the task
at hand have been found to reduce stereotype threat. (p. 23)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</contents>
